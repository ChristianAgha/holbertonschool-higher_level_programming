0x07. Python - Classes and Objects

OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It's VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type (and as usual never copy & paste), test and understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not take you more than 2/3 hours (tests excluded) if you take the time to read and understand everything. Read or watch in this order:

A simple introduction to Object Oriented Programming without going into much detail:
Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded
You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet
Object-Oriented Programming. Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class, in order to make you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything. Read only the following paragraphs:
General Introduction
First-class Everything
A Minimal Class in Python
Attributes
You NOT have to learn about class attributes
Methods
The __init__ Method
Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
Public- Protected- and Private Attributes
Properties vs. Getters and Setters
TL;DR; - A good wrap-up video about everything you need to know for this project: Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming
